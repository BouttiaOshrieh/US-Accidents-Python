# US-Accidents-Python
Analyzing the impact of weather conditions on accidents across US

In this project, we are examining whether a predictive model can be created through regression and cluster analysis to make accurate predictions on the impact of weather conditions on accidents across US. The project focuses mainly on the impact of weather-related factors, such as precipitation and humidity levels, on road visibility and the extent of the road affected by accidents.
